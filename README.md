# cocktail-android-sys
an end-to-end mobile to cloud application to provide recipes for beverages

My application provides users with a cocktail recipe. It takes a search string from the user, and uses it to fetch and display a cocktail image and information including category, isAlcoholic, ingredients and instructions (English/German).

Here is how my application meets the task requirements.
1 Implement a native Android Application.
The name of my native Android application project in Android Studio is:
FancyCocktail
1.1 Has at least two different kind of views in your Layout (TextView, EditText, ImageView, etc.)
My application uses TextView, EditText, Button, ImageView, Spinner and ScrollView. See content_main.xml and content_cocktail.xml for details of how they are incorporated into the LinearLayout or RelativeLayout.
Here is a screenshot of the layout before the user clicks on any button.
